Had 3 lumpectomies within 3 month span, had chemo, radiation, plus 1 year of Herceptin for Ductal carcinoma in situ T2 HER2+ I am alive and plan on staying that way. After much research and talking to doctors, the conclusion is that Chemo and Tamoxifen seem to have precipitated other chronic illnesses, Chronic Fatigue, Fibromyalgia, OsteoArthirtis, Osteopenia, Clinical depression, Gastroenteritis, worsened IBS and PTSD. My legs, lower back & fingers are usually swollen and usually in pain. I wanted  off the Tamoxifen, due to the weakness in my legs & Fatigue. No other was as effective in inhibiting estrogen. I still lose my hair, gained 130lbs, I'm in a wheelchair. I'm alive. 3 yrs to go",

I was told after surgery (June 2015) that I had to take \"Tomy\" for 5 years. I fought the idea, but eventually decided to give it a try.  So far, the main complaint I have is fatigue.  I take it at night and that's helps...  Some joint pain, vaginal discharge (clear mostly) and the BEST thing about Tommy is that it has calms me down.  I am about 30% of the energized person I was before.  I no longer get feel like I need to solve the worlds problems in a day!  So, I can honesty say, that's a big plus! ...   WEIGHT CHANGES:  I became Vegan and did not loose any weight! :((",

    "Post": "I started taking Tamoxifen in September of 2013. The side effects kicked in after about a week. My fingers completely seized up and if I crouched down I couldn't get up again! The joint pain was unbearable so my oncologist decided to take me off it for 6 months. He then introduced it gradually, 10mg a day instead of 20mg. So far so good! After 6 months of that he put me back up to the full dose and the pain didn't return! I've been on it ever since. My periods are here and there but are quite heavy and painful when I do get them. I wish they'd just stop. Just keeping everything crossed that the cancer stays away. Good luck to all you fellow survivors and keep fighting the fight! ",

After experiencing stomach digestive issues I went off it in March 2014 until August, then back on and have been on it ever since.  So almost 1 year straight, but another 5 months of it before that as well.  My biggest complaint is feeling so wiped out by the end of the day.  I take it at night when going to bed, usually 10pm-ish.  Does anyone think switching the time I take the pill will matter?  I have also noticed a 5-10 pound weight gain.  I'm very active and fit - lift weights, run, do crossfit.  I have found that the side effects of this drug are forcing me to live and eat cleaner to try and reduce them.",

Upset tummy is common, so try to keep hydrated. Seem to get lethargic, tired around 3-5pm, but take my medication just before bed, 10-11pm. May consider changing this. Given the alternatives and worrying how my family would cope without me as the bread winner, makes the decision to continue to take it an easy one. I am not going to give in to it. I'm 59,  and lost my brother to it aged 39. Played my first 70 min game of tennis today in 14 months, and really found it made a difference. So maybe keeping fit is one way of fighting back.",

A year after being off and the new research came out that I should do it another 5 years. I've been back on now for about 6 months and I'm seriously considering stopping. Side effects are so bad that I'm having a hard time getting through life. Mood swings and bone pain are my 2 main issues. The thing is, I'm cancer free and of course want to stay that way. I think that if my Doctors were more realistic (honest) about the side effects it would be a little easier to deal with them.

I started taking Tamoxifen about a month ago.  So far I am very fatigued, have headaches and some physical aches and pains.  I take my Tamoxifen in the morning, with my breakfast, because that seems to calm the nausea that I can get with an empty stomach.  The best thing that I am experiencing now that I am on the Tamoxifen is the ability to cry and work through emotion.  That ability had left me while I was just on the Effexor, I still felt sad, but didn't feel like I could cry.  Well the tears come now, and they feel cleansing and good.  I have much less anxiety about having a cancer re-occurrence.",

I am hoping that some of these side effects will soon subside.  Wow, it is amazing all the different side effects that Tamoxifen causes for people.

Only thing is, once it wears off (about 4-6 hours), the pain returns big time, and you're not supposed to use more than 2 tablets a day. Also, it made me ravenously hungry at the start (not so much now) so I've added a couple of Kg in weight. When it doesn't work well I take some Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) as well.

    "Post": "I was diagnosed with stage 0 breast cancer in my right breast in Jan. 2011; Lumpectomy in Feb. 2011; Radiation (6 weeks) March thru April 2011; and started taking the Tamoxifen medication in May 2011. I have been taking Tamoxifen for over three years now. I have had excessive hot flashes and mood swings. In the summer of 2013, I had to take a two months break from the medication because of my hot flashes.  I also have eyes irritations and itchy skin. Recently, Sept. 2014, I had a D & C to stop excessive bleeding, remove polyps and reduce the thickness of uterus walls. The polyps were noncancerous - Thank GOD. Now as a postmenopausal woman, I have to have my uterus removed, Jan. 2015, because of the contiuous bleeding and polyps quickly reforming. Although my Oncologist took me off of the Tamoxifen immediately, August 2014, because of the bleeding - the side effects continues.It makes me wonder if the benefits of the medication outweighs the many side effects that the medication causes. I have an appointment with my oncologist today to discuss medication options. I will see my primary care physician in a couple of weeks for health updates, just before seeing my ob/gyn surgeon in Jan. 2015. Ladies, make sure we do our part in getting the most effective health care by going to doctors and maintaining a personal health log. As a team, we can give breast cancer, a run for its money. God bless and good luck to all taking the breast cancer",

During my two months of taking the medication, I experienced chills, night sweats, extreme spike in sugar readings, aches and pains -- so bad I could not make it from room to room, face rash, etc.  I thought I was going to die.  My vision deteriorated so fast on this medication, I was afraid I was going blind.  Headaches were bad.  Mood swings, maybe just because I felt so horrible, were extreme.  My doctor insisted I still keep taking it, but I can't.  Been off for over a month now and still plagued with side effects but they have been lessening with time, and am getting stronger.  I am really afraid of returning breast cancer (or worse) but taking this again is not an option.  Quality of life was not there, I was turning into a vegetable.  Don't know what to do.",

However, I get up each morning achy, with pain in my knees and legs,sometimes my hands.

I bacame over whelmed with mood changes and hot flashed which then I was put on Effexor to control those symstoms.  I have also experenced weight gain, low energy. NO libedo and insomnia.  I have now been diagnosed with Osteoarthritis (OA) which is arthritis in the joints.  After researching this it can be caused from menapause which your body is put through like symtoms of menopause.  I believe this is from the Tamoxifen.  I am putting my health in the Lords hands.  I am now off the Tamoxifen and slowing coming off of the Effexor.  I have been off the Tamoxifen for a week and half and now have my life back.  My energy level has returned and leibdo back on track.  Plese do your research on this and talk to your physician. It really depends on the Stage you were diagnosed.  Several other ladies I have talk to that took Tamoxifen are also experiencing OA in the hands.  Research is the key.",

HOWEVER, after about 7-8 mths the Dr who prescribed me Wellbutrin (Bupropion 300mg/day) said that a study indicated the Wellbutrin would negate any affect of the Tamoxifen (NOT harmful just negate) so I went off it. My hair improved but unfortunately my weight went up (not drastically but there was a difference when on or off Tamoxifen).

    "Post": "Age 42 Breast cancer multi focal, Stage IIA two lympnodes positive, Mastectomy Nov 2010, AC+Taxol Jan 2011-June2011. I chose to wait 3 months before starting Tamoxifen on Oct 24, 2011. So far so good. I cannot identify the side effects directly related to tamoxifen because small side effects from Chemo still there a little bit. Hot flashes and joint pain from CHemo subsided and do not return with Tamoxifen. No bone pains or headaches. I have some sleeplessness but dealing with it by taking Tamoxifen in the morning, only one coffee in the morning, and dringking Camomile warm tea before bedtime. This is helping so far. Every other couple days, I will take 1-2 capsules of valarian roots to help get a good night sleep. You are not supposed to take this every day. Noticed slight weight gain but control with healthy eating and less portion of carbs at dinner time. No fried food. Big breafast and lunch with increase in vegetables and fresh fruits. I do not exercise! In fact,I notice a light weight loss this morning! I read a lot of reviews about this drug and took some preperation prior to starting Tamoxifen. I am now taking 1 Omega-3 in the morning, 1 multivitamin (1 a day woman) at lunch time and 1 calcium with D3/Mag/Zinc & 1 Omega-3 at Dinner time. I think this keeps me from having bone and joint pain and also keep blood clots which cause leg pains away. For those who have a lot of side effects, you might want to consult your doctor to see if these vitamins will help you. Good luck everyone! I hope my information helps!",

I was fortunate that my tumor was found in the early stage and most of it was removed when the biospy was taken; 6 wks of radiation and then 5 years of this...pretty simple   will make the effort to take this medication to make my life better/before breast cancer, hodgkins visited and had a stem cell transplant to rid myself of it; so Tamixofen doesn't seem to be a big deal to help prevent breast cancer!",

No side effects to talk about - a couple of days of being extremely thirsty. Weeks later - 2 depressed days. 6 months later - achy fingers which I don't even know if it's related to Tamoxifen... it's been 9 months and I haven't had a single hotflash. Just wanted to let people know that even though many get horrible sideeffects, it doesn't have to happen. You have to try it and see if it works for YOU.",

    "Post": "My Story: Stage III Breast Cancer in one breast, opted for Bi-lateral mast, 6 treatments chemo (TAC), 5 years of Tamoxifen (which I discontinued after the first month).  I was really stressing about whether or not to even start the drug but finally did so because \"Doctor knows best\".  Well, they don't.  They do the best they can and I'm grateful for them. But Doctors often recommend standard treatment for everyone (surgery, chemo, radiation, etc.), followed by 5 years of Tamoxifen.  Whether you take Tamoxifen or not your cancer could come back.  If they could tell me by taking Tamoxifen and dealing with the side effects that I would never get cancer again, I'd be the first one in line. But the truth is, there's no guarantee, so I'd like to make the choice about whether it's right for me rather than let a Doctor scare me into taking it.  Do your research about this drug before you make your decision ....I'm glad I did!",

    "Post": "I was diagnosed with bilateral cancer in Jan. 2009 & was 46 at that time.  It was caught early; stages 0 and 1 (non-invasive LC & DC stage 1). I opted for a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction & saline implants that followed half a year after my mastectomies.  When I first went on the tam., I was miserable with hot flashes, joint pain, a terribly broken out face, and I could not sleep at night.  My nephew had just committed suicide which did not help my emotional state... I went off the tam. until I saw my oncologist, who strongly encouraged me to go back on it.  He said side effects generally subside after a few months.  I have now been on tam. for 1 1/2 years.  For the past 6 months, I've had terrible pain in my calves & easily pull my calf muscles when doing any kind of exercise.  This has been hard for me because I like to be active (tennis, aerobics, biking)& I've put on weight since being on the med.  I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism after being on tam. for one year.  I was constantly cold & very fatigued - I attributed this to having 3 surgeries in 11 months.  I've now been on synthroid (75 mcg.) for 4 months & am feeling less tired & cold, but continue with the cramps/pulled muscles.  I struggle with staying on tam. - I feel as though my skin, face, & body have aged considerably in this short time.  I wonder how much of a risk there is for recurrence when there is little breast tissue left.  I feel my doctors are quite competent, & yet I wonder about their motives for pushing women to take tamoxifen.  If the muslce pain con't. & I can't figure out a way to treat it w/out more drugs, I am considering going off tam. altogether.",

I had Lumpectomy surgery and 33 treatments of Radiation---The Radiation was great---I felt like I was in a tanning bed. Since I have been on Tamoxifen-20mg. I have had side effects such as night sweats, headaches, dizziness and blurred vision. I am losing weight instead of gaining weight--which is great! I saw my doctor for other options-he said I can have my ovaries removed which would give me options of Femera, Aromasin or Arimidex. I checked on the reviews and the side effects tend to be simular. My other option would be to take 10mg in the am and 10mg in the PM to help reduce the side effects during the day when I am working. The other option would be to reduce to 10mg per day or not to take it at all---If I don't take it all all I will go from a 9% reoccurence to 13.5% re-occurrence. My doctor stated that I am youung and still producing Estrogen in my body---I  have decided that if I want to live a long life, I need to take this medication and just deal with the side effects. I know this will effect my quality of life for 5 years---I pray every day this does not come back---if taking this medication and possibly not even working for the next five years---I will do just that---because my health is that important to me.",

My expercience with Tamoxifen has been leg/foot cramping mostly at night, joint pain, short term memory problems, depression and hot flashes.    Last month my oncologist suggested taking SAMe 400mg 2-4 times daily for depression and joint pain. I have also changed my diet to an antifungal diet recommended by Doug Kaufmann from knowthecause.com.  So far my joint pain is about 80% better and my energy and motivation has noticably improved.  Still having ocassional leg cramps at night but the hot flashes have decreased...not sure if it's due to the diet change or the SAMe.  Hope this helps someone!\nGod Bless!!!",

Severe joint and muscle pain. Chronic yeast infections. No sex drive. Depression got so bad I was thinking seriously of suicide even while on lexapro. No energy and can't sleep even with ambien. Gained 25 lbs. even while going to aerobics 3 times a week, weight lifting and walking 10 miles per week. Had to stop all this exercise due to pain. Been of T 7 days and symptoms are improving. I was told by my oncologist that effexor will interfere in the effectiveness of T. T is a miracle drug for some but at some point I had to make a choice between recurrence of cancer and quality of life and I only made the decision after much prayer and careful consideration and have left the rest up to my Lord Jesus. Each of you need to make a decision based on your individual results and I encourage you to stay with T if you can bear the side effects.",

    "Post": "LCIS with 1mm invasive found with surgical biopsy. Lumpectomy showed no more invasive in the breast but lots of LCIS. Doctor was shocked to find 4 lymph nodes positive. Chemo followed. Then double mastectomies. Wanted to avoid the DIEP flap reconstruction so expanders were put in the same day. 5 weeks radiation. Have been on Tamoxifen for 3 months. First side effect noticed was my eyelashes were almost gone. Was scared to lose my hair again. Stopped T for 3 weeks but husband begged me to go back on it. Eyelashes are fully back. Main side effects since have been flushing, small headaches of short duration mainly around one eye, trouble sleeping, dizziness when suddenly sitting up or standing, no noticeable weight gain yet. I've read others comment on joint pain. I had achiness in my arms and legs after chemo. Had been drinking tons of water with Crystal Light as flavoring. It occured to my doc husband an uncommon side effect of the sweetener Aspartame is joint pain. Switched to Propel and the joint achiness immediately went away. Thought others would like to know this. Stay positive!!",

Blood work excellent and bilateral mammo perfect after a Stage 1 , lumpectomy and radiaiton last spring. Now, I have cystites in my uterous which were picked up by a tansvaginal ultra sound. Will have a biopsy done in the office on December 23rd. This is supposed to be a common side effect of T. Who knows? The probitic acidopholous really, really works. I also take lots of Vitamin D as per my oncologist. Dexascan slightly better this year than last. Still have osteoporosous so when I switch to Arimidex in 2 years, I will go on Actonel or Boniva.

I did Tamoxifen for 4 years at which time my memory was so bad I was leaving the elctric burners on, on the kitchen range. I also lost a very good job because of my memory problems. (My doctor said no one could prove that it caused memory loss at that time anyway.)  I then went off of Tamoxifen on my own. (My husband insisted.) My B.C. was Estrogen positive and had already had a complete hysterectomy 2 years before; but now cannot take hormone drugs ever again. My memory improved a lot after discontinuing the Tamoxifen.  Originally I was told that my memory would improve about a year after chemo; but it did not.  Still have memory problems; drawing blanks on words and transposing words; ie: hot for cold, etc.\n\nBut yes, I am a survivor and thank God every day for the extra time I have been given!!

    "Post": "I have ADD. The symptoms increased dramatically when I started using tamoxifen.Had to stop taking it after 2.5 years. It felt like having fibro-myalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome at the same time. I was severely depressed and even contemplated suicide. Was crippled by arthritis, couldn't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes, became disoriented, emotionally unstable. I'm a clinical psychologist, Ph.D., but had to stop working because of symptoms. None of my doctors could tell what was wrong with me. Stopped taking it 3 years ago, and much of my cognitive functioning hasn't returned. I know many doctors who admit they won't treat a patient who won't take tam. This is unconscionable, as is the behavior of doctors who withhold discussing possible side effects for fear patient will refuse it. As far as I could find out, there has been practically no research on the cognitive side-effects. I think it is absolutely essential that these cognitive symptoms receive attention and research. Patients with ADHD MUST BE WARNED of possible side effects. This drug can ruin your life.",

After taking this drug for 12 months I was exhausted and had nausea every morning that lasted through the entire day at times. Luckily my oncologist suspected liver damage and sent me to a liver specialist. Turns out my AST and ALT levels were steadily climbing. Four months later these levels were 10 times what they should be and I had developed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). I immediately stopped taking Tamoxifen but it took 6 months for my liver readings to return to normal. After consulting with my oncologist and radiologist we decided the risk to my liver was far greater than the risk of reoccurance. It's been almost a year now and I feel great!",

I am the only 1 of 7 girls (2nd to youngest)to have breast cancer. All sisters checked yearly was my first mammo. I starting taking this farce 2 months after initial surgery (no more breast tissue). Have been active and healty all my life. I can relate to the side effects. Starting 1 month after starting to take each of the following popped in at a rate of 2 each week. Depression, Blood pressure high even w/pills to lower, outer vaginal rash/itching all over, joint pain I limp after sitting at my desk at work, or driving, isomni, Sweating during the day just going to the bathroom or moving around, tired/ lack of motivation, gained 10 pounds immediately and then kept gaining and swelling everywhere could tell if I had any salt the day before. After I quit taking last month I want to get busy in the bedroom, exercise, don't have to keep buying clothes every week, take my girls to have fun and the sweats and cramping in legs and feet have decreased to a dull roar. I felt I was pushed into taking this pill and I see no benefit to my quality of life. Am encouraged to see other woman say no........ I will not take multiple other drugs to keep this other cancer causing pill under control. I enjoy keeping my wits about me to take care of my family,make choices to improve mental and physical health. I know there are other choices but for me I am looking forward to running and getting in snuggle time with my family.",

Treatment should include a slower introduction to the drug and move the dosage up to avoid the side effects.  I grind my pill up and put it in yogurt.  This lessened the side effects for me.  My breast tissue changed very quickly on this drug. They wanted me on 20 mg but the side effects were severe and I went on 10mg.  My mother survived breast cancer and was given 5 mg.

Radiation will decrease the chance of the cancer from coming back in the one breast. Tamoxifen decreases the chance 50% from cancer appearing any where. so the way i look at it is it is a 50/50 chance either way. Not enough for me to take Tamoxifen. This to me is a very scary drug. Everyone of course needs to make their own decisions. But before taking it i would research and not take it unless you feel comfortable with your decision.

Almost all info states that the risks are worth the benefits.  I am not convinced.  If my risk before the chemo and radiation was 10% of recurring, how much does taking this drug decrease my risk of getting breast cancer again.  I had a lumpectomy for stage 1, 1 cm ER positive tumor which had not spread to the lymph nodes, with good boundaries. What is the chance that I will develop another cancer due to taking the tamoxifen which is a known carcinogen.  How wise it to give women who have had breast cancer a drug that is a carcinogen?  My fear is that if I stop taking it, my luck it would return & then I would kick myself for not staying on it. IF I continue to take it, any one of many possible horrible side effects could occur. I wish I could have some peace of mind!  I am also concerned about what the lack of estrogen is doing to my aging process.  I feel that I have aged considerably since taking this medication.  Not to mention that if I have a stroke at my age, or vision problems, I may have 30 years to live with those side effects.  What are the odds of getting these side effects?  I haven't been able to find this information. If anyone can help answer these questions, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.",

    "Post": "So far so good. Learned after my second upset stomach to take with food. People , please look up the interactions and anything else on T. Be sure to tell your doctor all meds,  herbs and vitamins you are taking. They have now found out that depression meds can make T not work. Black Co hash is estrogen. Do NOT take Omega-3 Fatty Acids or any antioxidants. They interact with T. Now I am going to be tested for the CDY4D6 genotype. 7-10% of women will not benefit from T with this out of whack. Also, if have a variant of e-cadhern protein, T will cause a different kind of aggressive cancer. I have been on T for about a month and no side effects except my nails have become brittle even though I take gelatin caps. Small price to pay. I am Stage 1, oncaDX 15, had a lumpectomy and second surgery for clear margin. I have 12 more radiation treatments and have some redness since didn't really spread the aloe gel around. No chemo thank God!",

Havent had a good sleep since starting tamoxifen{two fans in bedroom, window open in winter  zero temperatures] wearing shorts and halters in daytime.  I just want to cry.I was always an easy going,happy  person, now I am tired ,hot and cranky. seeing doctor next week to see if some medication help or change will work. considering going off the drug as I cant live like this.",

All those symptoms disappeared after 60 days. I hung in there to give it enough time for my body to synthesize to the medication. The only remarkable issue I am having is a burning sensation around the vulva which I have never experienced prior to using this drug.  Can't seem to get a straight answer from anyone if it is related to the drug.  I will say this-I quit smoking recently using Chantix and I do think it has had a positive effect on mood enhancement due to the way it works with the dopamine receptors in the brain.  The mental fog has cleared that I was experiencing after treatment and early use of tamoxifen and I feel much more like I use to before cancer!",

Hot flashes were the worse and as I continued on the medicine they got so bad and started being accompanied with bouts of dizziness, once when driving.  Hot flash so intense gave me a very ill feeling in my body when it was happening and the longer I took the more sever they became.  Did not want to eat because just felt so bad.  Lost weight.  For the past 12 months it these side effects increased in intensity.  Would take pain pills on some days.  Started getting depression because felt so bad.  I quite taking them after 15 months (off now for 2 months).  I am gradually starting to feel better but I am afraid my bones in back may have been effected.  They are starting to crack sound when I turn or move.  Almost makes me feel like that are thining and I am worried now the wrong move can snap a bone in my back.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DRUG.  In spite of all this it only increases your chance of cancer not coming back by 2%.  The damage that this drug has caused is worse than the 1 stage of DCIS cancer I had.  Drug companies have got to make money even if it is at the cost of patients lives.  I am looking into more natural things I can do with eating better, exercising and taking vitamins if I need them.  My dr. even said that 2% means cancer may not come back in that breast but can come back somerwhere else even if you are on the med.  I choose quality over quanity.",

BUT!  now the nervousness, dizziness, sleeplessness have emerged.. I hate this feeling every single day and hope that with Stage 1 HER2negative, being told that I am lucky and this surgery/radiation should be the cure..  I am hoping that when I see the Dr in two months, I can go off of this drug..  I am a wreck and it's hard to cope with this drowsy, lethargic, jittery daily feeling, and now see where my hair thinning is attributable as well as weight gain ...  I see that others have this as well..  While the alternative is disastrous, living like this daily for the next 4 more years is not pleasant..  If I did not have to work, I think coping might be easier?  I'm not sure, but sitting at my desk, almost falling asleep by mid day is terrible..   I guess there is no alternative to this drug, but damn!! I will find out..",

    "Post": "Just finishing 5 miserable years on this drug, for stage 1 estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, a tiny tumor.  Seems like overkill, trying to smash a fly with a sledgehammer.  I doubt I even needed to be on this horrible drug, which caused the following side effects: very stiff and painful joints - especially in the hands and feet, hot flashes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, heart irregularities (had to be put on heart med to control), tired most days, minimal hair loss.  I feel 20 years older than I am, like a shriveled up old lady. Limping around.  I get off this drug in a month and will be celebrating my 60th birthday - hoping to feel younger instead of older.   If doctors had to experience these side effects, they might prescribe this medication less often.  I don't think it was worth going through 5 years of awful quality of life to lower my chance of a recurrence by just a few percentage points.  It hardly seems worth it, and I regret doing it. It's amazing how most doctors underestimate how awful this drug can be - my gynecologist implied I was being a big baby for complaining about it.  I will not be going back to her again.",

I was diagnosed in October 2014 with breast cancer had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal. The cancer had not spread to the nodes, thank god. I had radiotherapy for a month and will be having my final session in two days.I started the drug about 3 months ago. I have had no side effects like the ones that most of you have had. I do have slight pain in the hip area and lower left side. I attended my doctor who said it was a kidney infection, but the pain is still there. I don't know if it has anything got to do with the Arimidex. Apart from that I have no problems as yet with it. I'm so sorry to hear from all of you the pain that you are in, its terrible to go on suffering after all you have gone through with the cancer itself. We will all survive this, you have to have hope ladies, and hopefully another drug can be found that will bring us all back to the health we had before the cancer.

    "Post": "I had a double mastectomy with 4 positive lymph nodes and was Her2 positive. Spent a year taking Herceptin. I was started on arimidex 2 months before I finished my chemotherapy so did not realize for a while that the fatigue, continued hair loss, nausea, sleep problems and joint pain were because of the arimidex. My diabetes, which had been under control before the arimidex, became unmanageable. My oncologist refused to accept that the arimidex was causing any side effects. A few weeks ago I experienced shortness of breath and chest pains. My oncologist immediately took me off the arimidex while continuing to insist that I was not having side effects from the drug, but that I had heart disease. After a complete battery of tests my cardiologist told my oncologist that there was nothing wrong with my heart. My oncologist prescribed aromisin, which has the same and worse side effects. I have been off of arimidex for 3 weeks and finally feel like I am recovering from my chemotherapy, which actually ended in February (it is now October). I have decided to stop the drugs. I have had a negative PET scan and my blood work continues to show that I am cancer free. At age 65 I would like to live my life, and not merely exist. If the cancer comes back I will deal with it then. I am very happy with my decision but would not recommend it for everyone. You need to decide which is more important to you - doing what your doctor says will help or having a better quality of life. Also, there is no guarantee that the cancer will not recur just because one takes the drug.",

I have been taking the generic form of Arimidex, Anastrozole, for 20 days and have decided to discontinue the use.  I never experience side effects to medications I have taken in the past so I deliberately did not read the insert of side effects so that I wouldn't put the thought into my head that I would experience them.  In this short period of time I have suffered Waves of Nausea, Exhaustion, overall Body Pain that just cannot be alleviated with pain meds, Sleeplessness and Hot Flashes that could smelt iron ore.  I just looked at the side effects two days ago just to make sure I wasn't imagining that I could feel this miserable. The doctor wants me to take Effexor for the hot flashes but I vetoed that idea since I've not read anything positive about attempting to get off of that drug.  Taking one drug to mask the side effects of another just doesn't seem like a sound solution.  Unlike some other reviews I've read, I don't have the luxury of staying home and dealing with the side effects.  I have the responsibility of a job which I need to attend to daily and Arimidex most definitely is not conducive to this way of life.\nI wish you all well if you are prescribed this medication.",

No side effects, i felt great BUT my gyn doctor found lots uterin fybroids (sp) and after surgery was told i had to be put on the last resort, arimedex. My oncologist warned me that i may have joint pain like my first drug but she did not tell me about the hair loss, or blinding daily headaches or strange pains in my thumbs and it's only been 4 months. I'm supposed to be on this until Oct 2015 and I'm not sure what else to do. I can't stand the headaches anymore.

I have been taking Arimidex since November of 2010, along with an anti-depressant, Effexor.  I have experienced nausea (which has lessoned over time) and also joint pain.  The joint pain started slowly in an elbow joint and now is in just about every joint in my body.  My fingers are stiff in the morning and swollen (I have taken my rings off).  I have gained weight, but feel that has been a direct result of my feeling tired alot and not exercising like I should.  I broke my shoulder in March of 2011 and my Dr. immediately did a bone density test and found that I was fine.  While I am not enjoying the side-effects,  I realize that lobular breast cancer is one that recurs more frequently and I will be continuing the Arimidex because of that.  I have also read that those of us that experience joint pain are less likely to have a recurrence of the cancer after taking the Arimidex.",

    "Post": "Diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in July 2011.  Surgery to remove mass and took out 4 lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes were negative but could not get clear tissue around the mass.  Had mastectomy in Sept. 2011.  Surgeon did not see any need for chemo or radiation. Breast tissued tested and only a 10% chance of recurring. Sent to ongologist and I'll have to say he was the most arrogant doctor ever.  He demanded I take arimidex to rid my body of the estrogren, even though I'm 67 years old and my ovaries are completely dried up, they do not even show up on a c-scan.  He also wanted me to take Fosmax to increase my bone density.  I took Armidex for one month and all the side effects listed I had them.  Dr. said I had to stay on this.  Tried for another month and the side effects got worse.  Extreme anxity and depression, joint pain so bad I couldn't walk, can't sleep, body aches and muscle pain real bad.  I have irratible bowel anyway and it has really messed me up.  My gut hurts all day no matter what I eat.  I switched to another oncologist and she says the benefit far outweighs the side effects.  Been off the meds for 6 weeks and not much improvement yet.  I will never take Foxamax after learning the high risk of its side effects and the class action law suit now is progress.  Get on the web and get all  the horrible info. about this.   Know a woman who took this and almost died from the holes it ate in her stomach and gut.  I will take my chances without the meds and try to get my life back.  I'd rather have a few years of quality life than live like this. I think drs. want to scare us into taking these meds and they're always pushing pills at us. Most days can't even get out of bed.  I was in good health until this happened.

I had reservations about Arimidex  because of the bone loss. I already have osteoporosis, but the oncologist insisted I had to take it. Said I had \"no choice\". I started taking the generic form at the end of April 2011 and within two weeks started getting bad side effects.\nPain in my arms and legs (couldn't stand for more than 5 mins), especially knees and elbows which swelled up. Dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache (which went away eventually,) not sleeping, blurred vision, depression, absolutely no appetite, weight loss, hair loss, affected breast swelled up and was very painful. Then I started to get tingling and numbness in my hand which went up my arm. The patient information says this is an \"unlikely but very serious side affect\" and to call doctor immediately.\nOncologist said to stop taking it and see if the side effects go away. They did, and she said that I didn't need to take it. Said I was borderline whether I needed to or not. Hmmm. She didn't put me on anything else.\nAnyway I know some are asking what happens when you stop taking it and I am happy to report that all the side effects have gone, although the appetite is taking a while to come back, but I feel better than I have in a very long time. Of course I was only on it for a little over two months.\nGood luck and bottom line. Make your doctor listen to you.",

A total of 6 triger fingers, 4 I had surgery to correct. the surgery was very succesful. Joint pain remains a problem. I have gained over 40#. Head aches pain in the right eye, When I told my Dr. I was thinking about stoping the medicin. He said if I did I would risk the return of cancer and the choice was mine to make. I have gone this long I will try to go 1 more year. I am so glad I am not the only one having these symtoms as I thought I was going nuts.",

So far, it seems to be helping.\nOne important factor I think is that I didn't and still don't dwell on the cancer and I never stopped working or doing things due to the cancer. Only family knew of my condition.  I wore a wig.  I also choose to not give it any excessive attention.  I do get a check-up once a year and a mammogram/ultra sound about every two years.

So far no metastases (fingers crossed). \nI did experience frozen and very painful joints after taking it for a month, I felt like an old woman, I could hardly get up from my chair. I searched on Google and I read somewhere that this drug depletes your body from vitamin D (already low in many women with breast cancer) and that Vitamin D could stop the painful side effects. I got a blood test for vitamin D levels and sure enough it was very low. After I talked with my oncologist and we decided to try a high dose of vitamin D. I took 2000 U a day for a few months, which cleared the symptoms and got my vit D blood levels up, now I am on 1000 U a day and doing great.

Pain in feet so bad I can barely stand or walk, pain in both knees makes it difficult to walk up and down stairs, pain in both shoulders, memory so bad it frightens me. Oncologist tried to pass it off as \"Oh, sounds like you have rheumatoid arthritis, I'm sending you to a Rheumatologist\", to which I replied, \"No, you're not, this is a side effect of Arimidex, it's chemical not phsiological\".  Just what I need, another doctor appt. NOT!!!!!!! Glad I found these posting which helped me understand where all this pain came from so quickly.  My history...age 50-diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma with bone mets, 1 lumpectomy, 3 lymph nodes removed, all cancerous.... one year later... mastectomy, 19 more lymph nodes removed-all cancerous, breast reconstruction with implant, 5 weeks of radiation.  So.....for me, quality of life at this point is important.  I still work a full time job which is physically demanding, used to be very athletic, have gained 25 lbs. in short period of time. Doctor took me off Arimidex, put me on Aromisin for two weeks, no improvement of pain, then back on Tamoxifen. I liked the posting of the women who said she was 52 (my age) but felt 92!!!! Amen!!

It was very gradual.  Helped a lot.  No need to try to get off.  Why would anyone try to stop taking a medically necessary prescription?  If your brain has ceased making the necessary amount of serotonin to keep you stable, it is never going to get better.  You need to STAY on your meds.  People have caused their own problems by trying to stop taking meds on their own. Their doctors would have told them that if they had the sense to ask.",

My psychiatrist had me worked up to 225mg which I was told was the highest recommended dosage, and not too much longer after told me to take two pills, two times a day. This drug has ruined my life and turned me into a drug addict junkie and an awful person. This drug caused me to ruin many relationships in my life, caused multiple over doses and the biggest wake up call of my life. An overdose that put me into a coma for a week and the realization that years of my life were erased by the time I decided to become sober in 2013. It is now August 2015 and I am still obsessed with this drug. I have constant relapse dreams and vivid memories of how this drug made me feel that are destroying me, even though I have not taken this drug in almost 3 years. I still look for ways to get ahold of Effexor and how to get prescriptions. Do not sell your soul to this drug.",

When I was being taken off this product I had severe withdrawl symptoms: seizing/spasming of my entire body, feelings of zapping/electrocution in the head, sounds of electric buzzing/zapping, nausea, headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, vomiting, periods of unconsciousness - I was bedridden for 5 days.

    "Post": "I got brainwashed into a 1 year effexor treatment and it worked like a charm. 7 years of depression and anxiety simply vanished on the first pill. So did my interest in sex, erections, empathy and emotional depth, which were supposed to re-emerge after treatment so I didn't complain about it at the time. I also had an uncharacteristically positive disposition on the matter (high on serotonin) and I was afraid of going back to depression so I even passed down on the possibility of switching meds. When I consulted with the doc regarding going off the drug at the 1 year marker, he actually suggested prolonging treatment by another year since \"effexor is harmless\". I refused because the unexistent libido and cold erections were not something i was willing to endure for more than a year and i felt perfectly fine mood-wise. So, the doc told me to taper, I went cold turkey and through the typical withdrawal of hellish nightmares, dizzyness, brain zaps, irritability and inability to think for a week. One and a half year off the meds i got the empathy back... From my new psychiatrist that is, who keeps hearing about how my libido, erections and interest in activities are still far from normal and how his 3 colleagues which i previously tried to consult on the matter tried to force-convince me, first visit, that it's just me or i'm still depressed and effexor had nothing to do with it. He was sceptic at first and then stumbled upon some research which backed me up on the sexual stuff. He assumes that it's not permanent and has no idea on what to do to help, other than offer me some drug treatment(...), bear with my obsessive monologues of rage and regret and suggest alternative methods like acupuncture, which i haven't yet gotten around to trying due to procrastinating over the agonizing uncertainty. Mending a busted leg at the expense of an arm is hardly my idea of healing and a lifetime of unreasonable medication is simply unacceptable to me, so effexor and the like...NO!",

Like the other meds, Effexor did next to nothing to improve my depression or alleviate anxiety, except causing me to cry less (instead feelings are bottled up inside) and diminishing my libido. The main difference between Effexor and the other brands is much worse withdrawal symptoms. I've been following my doctor's instructions for weaning off the medicine for three weeks, still I experience debilitating dizziness and what feels like small electric shocks to the brain.

    "Post": "Effectiveness of Effexor XR (150 mg daily) for depression:  sadness and crying over nothing was practically eliminated;  enjoyed being with people again;  stopped worrying that something bad was going to happen;  easier to deal with life's difficulties.  Overall I think it was easier for others to be around me and a good drug of choice for the time.\n\nUndesirable side effects:  still had libido, but reduced orgasms to zilch...main reason for going off this drug.  Realistic nightmares the first year or so which diminished over time.  Extreme yawning and felt groggy always.  Dry mouth (which I think is a side effect of most anti-depressants).  A missed dosage (which seldom happened) would make me feel very light-headed and woozy.  Be sure to follow your Doctor's recommendations for changes in dosage (increase or decrease).\n\nWas off Effexor XR for about 9 months. Sex life improved 500%.  Energy level improved and gave me motivation to exercise and lose about 20 lbs.  Other than that, everything irritates me and I am not easy to be around (type A perfectionist that I am).

After getting on the correct dosage, which ended up being 225mg for me, I felt like my old self again. It's not a \"happy pill\" but simply allows me to feel the emotions of everyday life. I laugh like I used to before my depression, and yet can feel sad and cry at times when it would be typical to feel that way. Before this medication, I was just crying all the time - for no apparent reason. Other meds have caused me to feel NO emotions at all. Yes, the weight gain of about 15 pounds was frustrating but I could also do more to lose it. I do sweat more as well. I have only missed one dose and there were very minimal side effects which I was expecting - headache, some tingling when I moved my head suddenly.  When I told my doctor these side effects, he asked me if it was worth taking.......ABSOLUTELY. I know it isn't for everyone but for me - I'm just fine with it. I have my life back again.",

Only thing is, once it wears off (about 4-6 hours), the pain returns big time, and you're not supposed to use more than 2 tablets a day. Also, it made me ravenously hungry at the start (not so much now) so I've added a couple of Kg in weight. When it doesn't work well I take some Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) as well. Doesn't do anything for my headaches though and may even cause them.",

I have been taking Tamoxifen for over three years now. I have had excessive hot flashes and mood swings. In the summer of 2013, I had to take a two months break from the medication because of my hot flashes.  I also have eyes irritations and itchy skin. Recently, Sept. 2014, I had a D & C to stop excessive bleeding, remove polyps and reduce the thickness of uterus walls. The polyps were noncancerous - Thank GOD. Now as a postmenopausal woman, I have to have my uterus removed, Jan. 2015, because of the contiuous bleeding and polyps quickly reforming. Although my Oncologist took me off of the Tamoxifen immediately, August 2014, because of the bleeding - the side effects continues.It makes me wonder if the benefits of the medication outweighs the many side effects that the medication causes. I have an appointment with my oncologist today to discuss medication options. I will see my primary care physician in a couple of weeks for health updates, just before seeing my ob/gyn surgeon in Jan. 2015. Ladies, make sure we do our part in getting the most effective health care by going to doctors and maintaining a personal health log. As a team, we can give breast cancer, a run for its money.

    "Post": "I had a lumpectomy with nodes removed and was told I was cancer free.  As a precaution, had radiation but no chemo.  Then I was put on Tamoxifen.  This medication got progressively worse as I took it.  During my two months of taking the medication, I experienced chills, night sweats, extreme spike in sugar readings, aches and pains -- so bad I could not make it from room to room, face rash, etc.  I thought I was going to die.  My vision deteriorated so fast on this medication, I was afraid I was going blind.  Headaches were bad.  Mood swings, maybe just because I felt so horrible, were extreme.  My doctor insisted I still keep taking it, but I can't.  Been off for over a month now and still plagued with side effects but they have been lessening with time, and am getting stronger.  I am really afraid of returning breast cancer (or worse) but taking this again is not an option.  Quality of life was not there, I was turning into a vegetable.  Don't know what to do.",

I have been off the Tamoxifen for a week and half and now have my life back.  My energy level has returned and leibdo back on track.  Plese do your research on this and talk to your physician.

AND, a \"good\" side effect - I LOST weight! And I was not experiencing anything other adverse that would be of concern toward that. HOWEVER, after about 7-8 mths the Dr who prescribed me Wellbutrin (Bupropion 300mg/day) said that a study indicated the Wellbutrin would negate any affect of the Tamoxifen (NOT harmful just negate) so I went off it. My hair improved but unfortunately my weight went up (not drastically but there was a difference when on or off Tamoxifen). So as far as the Effectiveness rating, I couldn't really tell as not on long enough but I had to pick a rating so went 'middle-of-the-road'?",

So far so good. I cannot identify the side effects directly related to tamoxifen because small side effects from Chemo still there a little bit. Hot flashes and joint pain from CHemo subsided and do not return with Tamoxifen. No bone pains or headaches. I have some sleeplessness but dealing with it by taking Tamoxifen in the morning, only one coffee in the morning, and dringking Camomile warm tea before bedtime. This is helping so far. Every other couple days, I will take 1-2 capsules of valarian roots to help get a good night sleep. You are not supposed to take this every day. Noticed slight weight gain but control with healthy eating and less portion of carbs at dinner time. No fried food. Big breafast and lunch with increase in vegetables and fresh fruits. I do not exercise! In fact,I notice a light weight loss this morning! I read a lot of reviews about this drug and took some preperation prior to starting Tamoxifen. I am now taking 1 Omega-3 in the morning, 1 multivitamin (1 a day woman) at lunch time and 1 calcium with D3/Mag/Zinc & 1 Omega-3 at Dinner time. I think this keeps me from having bone and joint pain and also keep blood clots which cause leg pains away. For those who have a lot of side effects, you might want to consult your doctor to see if these vitamins will help you. Good luck everyone! I hope my information helps!",

I was fortunate that my tumor was found in the early stage and most of it was removed when the biospy was taken; 6 wks of radiation and then 5 years of this...pretty simple   will make the effort to take this medication to make my life better/before breast cancer, hodgkins visited and had a stem cell transplant to rid myself of it; so Tamixofen doesn't seem to be a big deal to help prevent breast cancer!",

Bone/Joint pain; couldn't think clearly so Dr. put me on Clonidine. Not many hot flashes, but I don't sleep well; I now have age spots; I just feel old and rundown. I walk everyday so I do stay active, but the bone pain makes it difficult.Have had some depression but I am peri-menopausal so that could contribute. Not sure I will stay with Tamoxifen for 5 years. Afraid I will age another 20 years in 4 1/2. If my cancer wasn't caught so early and my chances of reoccurance were greater, it might be worth it.",

I was really stressing about whether or not to even start the drug but finally did so because \"Doctor knows best\".  Well, they don't.  They do the best they can and I'm grateful for them. But Doctors often recommend standard treatment for everyone (surgery, chemo, radiation, etc.), followed by 5 years of Tamoxifen.  Whether you take Tamoxifen or not your cancer could come back.  If they could tell me by taking Tamoxifen and dealing with the side effects that I would never get cancer again, I'd be the first one in line. But the truth is, there's no guarantee, so I'd like to make the choice about whether it's right for me rather than let a Doctor scare me into taking it.

    "Post": "I was diagnosed with bilateral cancer in Jan. 2009 & was 46 at that time.  It was caught early; stages 0 and 1 (non-invasive LC & DC stage 1). I opted for a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction & saline implants that followed half a year after my mastectomies.  When I first went on the tam., I was miserable with hot flashes, joint pain, a terribly broken out face, and I could not sleep at night.  My nephew had just committed suicide which did not help my emotional state... I went off the tam. until I saw my oncologist, who strongly encouraged me to go back on it.  He said side effects generally subside after a few months.  I have now been on tam. for 1 1/2 years.  For the past 6 months, I've had terrible pain in my calves & easily pull my calf muscles when doing any kind of exercise.  This has been hard for me because I like to be active (tennis, aerobics, biking)& I've put on weight since being on the med.  I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism after being on tam. for one year.  I was constantly cold & very fatigued - I attributed this to having 3 surgeries in 11 months.  I've now been on synthroid (75 mcg.) for 4 months & am feeling less tired & cold, but continue with the cramps/pulled muscles.  I struggle with staying on tam. - I feel as though my skin, face, & body have aged considerably in this short time.  I wonder how much of a risk there is for recurrence when there is little breast tissue left.  I feel my doctors are quite competent, & yet I wonder about their motives for pushing women to take tamoxifen.  If the muslce pain con't. & I can't figure out a way to treat it w/out more drugs, I am considering going off tam. altogether.",

Removed a few lymph nodes, found cancer in all, but did radiation on all of them as well vs removal of remainder. Completed treatment 2004, tamoxifen completed August 2009. I also had hot flashes, but I went thru immediate menopause so understandable. Also had severe leg cramps, weight gain and nails would not grow. They were rock solid before and were brittle and broke easily. Now that I am off, they grow normally. Also had memory loss and forgetfullness that has not gone away. Chemo related and tamoxifen enhanced. But I'm still here, so it's all worth it!",

Lymphnodes negative---Estrogen Positive--Oncodyte Test was good---I scored 12 out of 100. this gives me a 9% Re-occurrnece. I had Lumpectomy surgery and 33 treatments of Radiation---The Radiation was great---I felt like I was in a tanning bed. Since I have been on Tamoxifen-20mg. I have had side effects such as night sweats, headaches, dizziness and blurred vision. I am losing weight instead of gaining weight--which is great! I saw my doctor for other options-he said I can have my ovaries removed which would give me options of Femera, Aromasin or Arimidex. I checked on the reviews and the side effects tend to be simular. My other option would be to take 10mg in the am and 10mg in the PM to help reduce the side effects during the day when I am working. The other option would be to reduce to 10mg per day or not to take it at all---If I don't take it all all I will go from a 9% reoccurence to 13.5% re-occurrence. My doctor stated that I am youung and still producing Estrogen in my body---I  have decided that if I want to live a long life, I need to take this medication and just deal with the side effects. I know this will effect my quality of life for 5 years---I pray every day this does not come back---if taking this medication and possibly not even working for the next five years---I will do just that---because my health is that important to me.",

I was initally perscribed Arimadex and took it for about 6 months.  I had to stop because I couldn't tolerate the side effects. My expercience with Tamoxifen has been leg/foot cramping mostly at night, joint pain, short term memory problems, depression and hot flashes.    Last month my oncologist suggested taking SAMe 400mg 2-4 times daily for depression and joint pain. I have also changed my diet to an antifungal diet recommended by Doug Kaufmann from knowthecause.com.  So far my joint pain is about 80% better and my energy and motivation has noticably improved.  Still having ocassional leg cramps at night but the hot flashes have decreased...not sure if it's due to the diet change or the SAMe.  Hope this helps someone!\nGod Bless!!!",

I was told by my oncologist that effexor will interfere in the effectiveness of T. T is a miracle drug for some but at some point I had to make a choice between recurrence of cancer and quality of life and I only made the decision after much prayer and careful consideration and have left the rest up to my Lord Jesus. Each of you need to make a decision based on your individual results and I encourage you to stay with T if you can bear the side effects.",

I had swelling of face hands and feet, Weight gain, unbearable leg and feet pain. I am switching back to Tamoxifen after consulting with my oncologist.  Aromasin just was not tolerated well. I am a very happy active person and I could not even take walks anymore and became so depressed. Hopefully on Tamoxifen again, I will have the night sweats again but not the pain I have been experiencing with Aromasin.",

I took Tamoxifen for 6 weeks, and of the 20 plus side effects they list I saw about 15 of them along with a couple not listed.  Huge blood spots broke out under the skin on both legs, I lost about 20 lbs, and have never felt so bad in my life.  Words do not describe how this medicine made me feel. Cramping toes, unbelievable hot flashes, no appetite, extreme tiredness, fuzzy brained....I could go on. I will take my chances on recurrance of cancer than have the quality of life I had with this medication.",

I did Tamoxifen for 4 years at which time my memory was so bad I was leaving the elctric burners on, on the kitchen range. I also lost a very good job because of my memory problems. (My doctor said no one could prove that it caused memory loss at that time anyway.)  I then went off of Tamoxifen on my own. (My husband insisted.) My B.C. was Estrogen positive and had already had a complete hysterectomy 2 years before; but now cannot take hormone drugs ever again. My memory improved a lot after discontinuing the Tamoxifen.  Originally I was told that my memory would improve about a year after chemo; but it did not.  Still have memory problems; drawing blanks on words and transposing words; ie: hot for cold, etc.\n\nBut yes, I am a survivor and thank God every day for the extra time I have been given!! God Bless you all as you go through this journey....",

Was crippled by arthritis, couldn't remember anything for more than a couple of minutes, became disoriented, emotionally unstable. I'm a clinical psychologist, Ph.D., but had to stop working because of symptoms. None of my doctors could tell what was wrong with me. Stopped taking it 3 years ago, and much of my cognitive functioning hasn't returned. I know many doctors who admit they won't treat a patient who won't take tam. This is unconscionable, as is the behavior of doctors who withhold discussing possible side effects for fear patient will refuse it. As far as I could find out, there has been practically no research on the cognitive side-effects. I think it is absolutely essential that these cognitive symptoms receive attention and research. Patients with ADHD MUST BE WARNED of possible side effects. This drug can ruin your life.",

Luckily my oncologist suspected liver damage and sent me to a liver specialist. Turns out my AST and ALT levels were steadily climbing. Four months later these levels were 10 times what they should be and I had developed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). I immediately stopped taking Tamoxifen but it took 6 months for my liver readings to return to normal.

I am the only 1 of 7 girls (2nd to youngest)to have breast cancer. All sisters checked yearly was my first mammo. I starting taking this farce 2 months after initial surgery (no more breast tissue). Have been active and healty all my life. I can relate to the side effects. Starting 1 month after starting to take each of the following popped in at a rate of 2 each week. Depression, Blood pressure high even w/pills to lower, outer vaginal rash/itching all over, joint pain I limp after sitting at my desk at work, or driving, isomni, Sweating during the day just going to the bathroom or moving around, tired/ lack of motivation, gained 10 pounds immediately and then kept gaining and swelling everywhere could tell if I had any salt the day before. After I quit taking last month I want to get busy in the bedroom, exercise, don't have to keep buying clothes every week, take my girls to have fun and the sweats and cramping in legs and feet have decreased to a dull roar. I felt I was pushed into taking this pill and I see no benefit to my quality of life. Am encouraged to see other woman say no........ I will not take multiple other drugs to keep this other cancer causing pill under control. I enjoy keeping my wits about me to take care of my family,make choices to improve mental and physical health. I know there are other choices but for me I am looking forward to running and getting in snuggle time with my family.",

    "Post": "Get ready for the ride\"...as a doctor described candidly what he has seen with this drug.  I will be as simplistic as possible.  Benefits seem to outweigh the negatives.  Treatment should include a slower introduction to the drug and move the dosage up to avoid the side effects.  I grind my pill up and put it in yogurt.  This lessened the side effects for me.  My breast tissue changed very quickly on this drug. They wanted me on 20 mg but the side effects were severe and I went on 10mg.  My mother survived breast cancer and was given 5 mg.  I think this is a miracle drug from what we have seen in my family.  Caution should be used  to adjust your body to this drug.",

I do get sad but never suicidal or deeply depressed. Giving up watching the news and crime shows daily cured my blues. Gained some weight and ran to see Jenny Craig! I have had some increased amounts of hair falling out however completely unnoticeable. And finally, I have had only one period since my double mastectomy last June which was two and a half months before I started taking Tamoxifen. What a nice bonus! I have also had three reconstructive surgeries while taking Tamoxifen with no problems. Attitude is 90% of the cure. I am happy, I am alive! Don't sweat the little side affects, things could always be worse. Good luck to you all. :)",

Depression  Was so bad that I was threatened with termination from work. Was told \"Having cancer was not as bad as getting a divorce\".  A lot they would know.  These 2 ladies who told me that should walk a mile in my shoes.  Finally,  I sought a 2nd opinion from another oncolgist.  He reviewed my history and since I had less than 1 cm lump that had not spread, he decided that I could go off both of the medicines I had tried at one time or another.  My depression was so bad that I am now on Cymbalta, thank goodness it has helped.  I am still having side effects after almost a year but they are slowly disappearing.",

Had lumpectomy and am starting radiation next week. My doctor explained to me that Tamoxifen is separate from radiation, it does not go hand in hand. Radiation will decrease the chance of the cancer from coming back in the one breast. Tamoxifen decreases the chance 50% from cancer appearing any where. so the way i look at it is it is a 50/50 chance either way. Not enough for me to take Tamoxifen. This to me is a very scary drug. Everyone of course needs to make their own decisions. But before taking it i would research and not take it unless you feel comfortable with your decision. I hope this helps people trying to make this decision. talk to your doctor, surgeon, oncologist, and radiation doctor before making your decision.",

    "Post": "I am frustrated that I have not been able to find statistics that would help me make an educated decision on whether or not to continue the tamoxifen as I am very concerned about all the possible side effects.  Almost all info states that the risks are worth the benefits.  I am not convinced.  If my risk before the chemo and radiation was 10% of recurring, how much does taking this drug decrease my risk of getting breast cancer again.  I had a lumpectomy for stage 1, 1 cm ER positive tumor which had not spread to the lymph nodes, with good boundaries. What is the chance that I will develop another cancer due to taking the tamoxifen which is a known carcinogen.  How wise it to give women who have had breast cancer a drug that is a carcinogen?  My fear is that if I stop taking it, my luck it would return & then I would kick myself for not staying on it. IF I continue to take it, any one of many possible horrible side effects could occur. I wish I could have some peace of mind!  I am also concerned about what the lack of estrogen is doing to my aging process.  I feel that I have aged considerably since taking this medication.  Not to mention that if I have a stroke at my age, or vision problems, I may have 30 years to live with those side effects.  What are the odds of getting these side effects?  I haven't been able to find this information. If anyone can help answer these questions, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.",

Do NOT take Omega-3 Fatty Acids or any antioxidants. They interact with T. Now I am going to be tested for the CDY4D6 genotype. 7-10% of women will not benefit from T with this out of whack.

I've been taking tamoxifen for 3 months now.  I had regular periods for the first two months, no period this month.  Night sweats (bearable), some fuzzy-headedness, dry mouth (especially during winter).  Minute weight gain, but my side hurts where the lump was removed.  I read another lady had the same problem.  I find that when I use that side (stretching, lifting, sometimes even holding the leash in that hand when I walk the dogs) causes that side to hurt.  I try to favor the left and use heat when the right bothers me.  \nNot having a period is weird, don't know yet whether I like it or not.  Sex life is fine.

I had 2 lumpectomies, radiation, and bilateral mastectomies.  i've been taking tamoxifen for about a year and a half i think.  i had no peri-menopausal symptoms prior to taking it.  i still don't have hot flashes, night sweats, or anything like that, but my period trickled off and now i've only had 1 period in the past year.  my gynocologist said i have plenty of hormones and am not peri or menopausal.  i never thought i'd miss my period ... i think i've been somewhat depressed since i started taking it.  i've had some very squishy weight gain.  i've had all kinds of gynecological issues that i never use to have.  i've been diagnosed with lichen sclerosis.  i have an ongoing yeast infection and i don't have a history of them.  at least i had a good sex life til i was diagnosed with those, now it hurts to have sex.  i wish i knew more pre-menopausal women on tamoxifen to talk to.  i hate this med but my oncologist doesn't seem to want to talk about anything else.   i don't know if the medicine is \"effective\" for me until i live the rest of my life without getting breast cancer again so i rated that a \"1\".  sure, the medication is \"easy\" to use, i swallow a pill every day.  i'm not sure if tamoxifen is causing my gynecological problems, depression, weight gain, and tiredness, but in case it is, i'll rate \"ease of use\" a \"1\", too.  damn.  i didn't realize how much i sounded like eeyore.",

Uncontrollable hot flashes, horrible weight gain, pains and aches. Hot flashes were not controllable even after effexor. Doctor switched me to Evista and although the weight gain is bad, the effects of evista are hardly anything. Am happy i am off the tamoxifen.

YES!!! 3 days ago I stopped taking Tamoxifen and I am already starting to feel better. I was told that I should feel like a new woman within 2 weeks. I am counting down the days. Right now I do fine for a while and then all of a sudden I can't keep my eyes open. My doctor said that I will be that way for a little while and then one day I will wake up and be totaly awake and have my energy back.

I will say this-I quit smoking recently using Chantix and I do think it has had a positive effect on mood enhancement due to the way it works with the dopamine receptors in the brain.

Hot flashes were the worse and as I continued on the medicine they got so bad and started being accompanied with bouts of dizziness, once when driving.  Hot flash so intense gave me a very ill feeling in my body when it was happening and the longer I took the more sever they became.  Did not want to eat because just felt so bad.  Lost weight.  For the past 12 months it these side effects increased in intensity.  Would take pain pills on some days.  Started getting depression because felt so bad.  I quite taking them after 15 months (off now for 2 months).  I am gradually starting to feel better but I am afraid my bones in back may have been effected.  They are starting to crack sound when I turn or move.  Almost makes me feel like that are thining and I am worried now the wrong move can snap a bone in my back.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE DRUG.  In spite of all this it only increases your chance of cancer not coming back by 2%.  The damage that this drug has caused is worse than the 1 stage of DCIS cancer I had.  Drug companies have got to make money even if it is at the cost of patients lives.  I am looking into more natural things I can do with eating better, exercising and taking vitamins if I need them.  My dr. even said that 2% means cancer may not come back in that breast but can come back somerwhere else even if you are on the med.  I choose quality over quanity.",

I doubt I even needed to be on this horrible drug, which caused the following side effects: very stiff and painful joints - especially in the hands and feet, hot flashes, dry mouth, vaginal dryness, heart irregularities (had to be put on heart med to control), tired most days, minimal hair loss.  I feel 20 years older than I am, like a shriveled up old lady. Limping around.  I get off this drug in a month and will be celebrating my 60th birthday - hoping to feel younger instead of older.   If doctors had to experience these side effects, they might prescribe this medication less often.  I don't think it was worth going through 5 years of awful quality of life to lower my chance of a recurrence by just a few percentage points.  It hardly seems worth it, and I regret doing it.

I do have slight pain in the hip area and lower left side. I attended my doctor who said it was a kidney infection, but the pain is still there.

I was started on arimidex 2 months before I finished my chemotherapy so did not realize for a while that the fatigue, continued hair loss, nausea, sleep problems and joint pain were because of the arimidex. My diabetes, which had been under control before the arimidex, became unmanageable. My oncologist refused to accept that the arimidex was causing any side effects. A few weeks ago I experienced shortness of breath and chest pains. My oncologist immediately took me off the arimidex while continuing to insist that I was not having side effects from the drug, but that I had heart disease. After a complete battery of tests my cardiologist told my oncologist that there was nothing wrong with my heart. My oncologist prescribed aromisin, which has the same and worse side effects. I have been off of arimidex for 3 weeks and finally feel like I am recovering from my chemotherapy, which actually ended in February (it is now October). I have decided to stop the drugs. I have had a negative PET scan and my blood work continues to show that I am cancer free. At age 65 I would like to live my life, and not merely exist. If the cancer comes back I will deal with it then. I am very happy with my decision but would not recommend it for everyone. You need to decide which is more important to you - doing what your doctor says will help or having a better quality of life. Also, there is no guarantee that the cancer will not recur just because one takes the drug.",

My family says that I am totally despondent the majority of the time. Also, I do not act like myself and the irritability causes me not to even want to be around myself. I guess due to lack of sleep. I'm very afraid to stop it because when I call the doctor's office, all I get back is, «it's more important than the chemotherapy. I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do.",

    "Post": "I had a low grade carcinoma and lumpectomy with two lymph nodes removed both of which were clear as well as the surrounding tissue of the small tumor.  I have been taking the generic form of Arimidex, Anastrozole, for 20 days and have decided to discontinue the use.  I never experience side effects to medications I have taken in the past so I deliberately did not read the insert of side effects so that I wouldn't put the thought into my head that I would experience them.  In this short period of time I have suffered Waves of Nausea, Exhaustion, overall Body Pain that just cannot be alleviated with pain meds, Sleeplessness and Hot Flashes that could smelt iron ore.  I just looked at the side effects two days ago just to make sure I wasn't imagining that I could feel this miserable. The doctor wants me to take Effexor for the hot flashes but I vetoed that idea since I've not read anything positive about attempting to get off of that drug.  Taking one drug to mask the side effects of another just doesn't seem like a sound solution.  Unlike some other reviews I've read, I don't have the luxury of staying home and dealing with the side effects.  I have the responsibility of a job which I need to attend to daily and Arimidex most definitely is not conducive to this way of life.\nI wish you all well if you are prescribed this medication.",

After 18 months, I have stopped the Arimidex.  Oncologist put me on Femera, but the aches and pain were worse. Now I have 6 trigger fingers, constant shoulder and elbow pain. The swelling in my hands and knees have been unbearable.  My blood work indicates that my cholesterol is increasing. Now I am watching my blood pressure increase.  So, no more pills. No more Effexor of hot flashes either.  I do take a Biotin supplement for hair thinning - hair has thickened.  I have chosen quality over quantity for my life.  I have always been extremely active, but this past 1 1/2 yrs has been miserable.  I hope other folks have better luck, but after reading reviews, I am so very grateful to know I am not crazy.  My primary doctor even said my side effects were in my head - which I pointed out the side effects had not affected my head yet!  Good luck folks.",

The most problematic is lack of sleep and some weight gain (particularly in my gut area). This is despite exercising more than I have ever done. There is also stiffness, some pain and the general feeling of being unwell. Sometimes it is hard to get around as my joints seem unpredictable and my muscles taunt. I now have very high cholesterol and high blood pressure (both new issues) and recurrent depression and anxiety disorder. Overall, I prefer to remain at home where there are no expectations of me and I do not have the stress of preparing to go out or coping in social settings. This includes seeing my immediate family which makes me feel even more guilty. I have taken the drugs for a year and a half and do not have a foreseeable end to this.

The joint pain started slowly in an elbow joint and now is in just about every joint in my body.  My fingers are stiff in the morning and swollen (I have taken my rings off).  I have gained weight, but feel that has been a direct result of my feeling tired alot and not exercising like I should.  I broke my shoulder in March of 2011 and my Dr. immediately did a bone density test and found that I was fine.  While I am not enjoying the side-effects,  I realize that lobular breast cancer is one that recurs more frequently and I will be continuing the Arimidex because of that.

Had mastectomy in Sept. 2011.  Surgeon did not see any need for chemo or radiation. Breast tissued tested and only a 10% chance of recurring. Sent to ongologist and I'll have to say he was the most arrogant doctor ever.  He demanded I take arimidex to rid my body of the estrogren, even though I'm 67 years old and my ovaries are completely dried up, they do not even show up on a c-scan.  He also wanted me to take Fosmax to increase my bone density.  I took Armidex for one month and all the side effects listed I had them.  Dr. said I had to stay on this.  Tried for another month and the side effects got worse.  Extreme anxity and depression, joint pain so bad I couldn't walk, can't sleep, body aches and muscle pain real bad.  I have irratible bowel anyway and it has really messed me up.  My gut hurts all day no matter what I eat.  I switched to another oncologist and she says the benefit far outweighs the side effects.  Been off the meds for 6 weeks and not much improvement yet.  I will never take Foxamax after learning the high risk of its side effects and the class action law suit now is progress.  Get on the web and get all  the horrible info. about this.   Know a woman who took this and almost died from the holes it ate in her stomach and gut.  I will take my chances without the meds and try to get my life back.  I'd rather have a few years of quality life than live like this. I think drs. want to scare us into taking these meds and they're always pushing pills at us. Most days can't even get out of bed.  I was in good health until this happened.

I had reservations about Arimidex  because of the bone loss. I already have osteoporosis, but the oncologist insisted I had to take it. Said I had \"no choice\". I started taking the generic form at the end of April 2011 and within two weeks started getting bad side effects.\nPain in my arms and legs (couldn't stand for more than 5 mins), especially knees and elbows which swelled up. Dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache (which went away eventually,) not sleeping, blurred vision, depression, absolutely no appetite, weight loss, hair loss, affected breast swelled up and was very painful. Then I started to get tingling and numbness in my hand which went up my arm. The patient information says this is an \"unlikely but very serious side affect\" and to call doctor immediately.\nOncologist said to stop taking it and see if the side effects go away. They did, and she said that I didn't need to take it. Said I was borderline whether I needed to or not. Hmmm. She didn't put me on anything else.\nAnyway I know some are asking what happens when you stop taking it and I am happy to report that all the side effects have gone, although the appetite is taking a while to come back, but I feel better than I have in a very long time. Of course I was only on it for a little over two months.\nGood luck and bottom line. Make your doctor listen to you.",

I had a mastectomy in 2009 and took the Tamoxifin first, switched to Femera, and now Arimidex.  I have been on the Arimidex for about 6 months and the side effects are no better than the Femara.  I am stiff and sore most of the time, had the weight gain, but the worst of the side effects for me is the memory loss.  They call it \"chemo brain\".  It effects my everyday life, my job, etc.  I am thankful to have read everyone's responses though.  It lets you know that you are not alone.",

So far no metastases (fingers crossed). \nI did experience frozen and very painful joints after taking it for a month, I felt like an old woman, I could hardly get up from my chair. I searched on Google and I read somewhere that this drug depletes your body from vitamin D (already low in many women with breast cancer) and that Vitamin D could stop the painful side effects. I got a blood test for vitamin D levels and sure enough it was very low. After I talked with my oncologist and we decided to try a high dose of vitamin D. I took 2000 U a day for a few months, which cleared the symptoms and got my vit D blood levels up, now I am on 1000 U a day and doing great.

Pain in feet so bad I can barely stand or walk, pain in both knees makes it difficult to walk up and down stairs, pain in both shoulders, memory so bad it frightens me. Oncologist tried to pass it off as \"Oh, sounds like you have rheumatoid arthritis, I'm sending you to a Rheumatologist\", to which I replied, \"No, you're not, this is a side effect of Arimidex, it's chemical not phsiological\".  Just what I need, another doctor appt. NOT!!!!!!! Glad I found these posting which helped me understand where all this pain came from so quickly.  My history...age 50-diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma with bone mets, 1 lumpectomy, 3 lymph nodes removed, all cancerous.... one year later... mastectomy, 19 more lymph nodes removed-all cancerous, breast reconstruction with implant, 5 weeks of radiation.  So.....for me, quality of life at this point is important.  I still work a full time job which is physically demanding, used to be very athletic, have gained 25 lbs. in short period of time. Doctor took me off Arimidex, put me on Aromisin for two weeks, no improvement of pain, then back on Tamoxifen. I liked the posting of the women who said she was 52 (my age) but felt 92!!!! Amen!!

An overdose that put me into a coma for a week and the realization that years of my life were erased by the time I decided to become sober in 2013. It is now August 2015 and I am still obsessed with this drug.

It doesn't make my life 100% amazing or even 75% and all problems go away instantly in any means, I get really sad still, but I can function. For anyone struggling to see improvement when taking anti-depressants, please don't give up.

    "Post": "I got brainwashed into a 1 year effexor treatment and it worked like a charm. 7 years of depression and anxiety simply vanished on the first pill. So did my interest in sex, erections, empathy and emotional depth, which were supposed to re-emerge after treatment so I didn't complain about it at the time. I also had an uncharacteristically positive disposition on the matter (high on serotonin) and I was afraid of going back to depression so I even passed down on the possibility of switching meds. When I consulted with the doc regarding going off the drug at the 1 year marker, he actually suggested prolonging treatment by another year since \"effexor is harmless\". I refused because the unexistent libido and cold erections were not something i was willing to endure for more than a year and i felt perfectly fine mood-wise. So, the doc told me to taper, I went cold turkey and through the typical withdrawal of hellish nightmares, dizzyness, brain zaps, irritability and inability to think for a week. One and a half year off the meds i got the empathy back... From my new psychiatrist that is, who keeps hearing about how my libido, erections and interest in activities are still far from normal and how his 3 colleagues which i previously tried to consult on the matter tried to force-convince me, first visit, that it's just me or i'm still depressed and effexor had nothing to do with it. He was sceptic at first and then stumbled upon some research which backed me up on the sexual stuff. He assumes that it's not permanent and has no idea on what to do to help, other than offer me some drug treatment(...), bear with my obsessive monologues of rage and regret and suggest alternative methods like acupuncture, which i haven't yet gotten around to trying due to procrastinating over the agonizing uncertainty. Mending a busted leg at the expense of an arm is hardly my idea of healing and a lifetime of unreasonable medication is simply unacceptable to me, so effexor and the like...NO!",

Overall I think it was easier for others to be around me and a good drug of choice for the time.\n\nUndesirable side effects:  still had libido, but reduced orgasms to zilch...main reason for going off this drug.  Realistic nightmares the first year or so which diminished over time.  Extreme yawning and felt groggy always.  Dry mouth (which I think is a side effect of most anti-depressants).  A missed dosage (which seldom happened) would make me feel very light-headed and woozy.  Be sure to follow your Doctor's recommendations for changes in dosage (increase or decrease).\n\nWas off Effexor XR for about 9 months. Sex life improved 500%.  Energy level improved and gave me motivation to exercise and lose about 20 lbs.  Other than that, everything irritates me and I am not easy to be around (type A perfectionist that I am).

I had no history of high blood pressure or heart disease.  I was given 5 nitroglycerin tablets under my tongue pand then a patch to get my blood pressure down.  I had to spend 3 days in the hospital (without health insurance) and now I am in debt for $24,000.  I told my dr I was having side effects and he said that he never heard of the symptoms I complained about while taking Effexor..he actually doubled my dose.  That's when I ended up going to the hospital.  Even though I only took it for about 8 or 9 weeks, the withdrawal was horrible..also, the medicine and psychiatrist costs were very expensive,,,terrible experience.",

Would never ever take it again, im back on Paroxetine along with Lyrica now and its probably my best combination, ill never feel 100% normal but hell anything is better than how I felt on this drug!",

Then I was executor and power of attorney for my mother's will.  Next a step-daughter-in-law and my stepson disowned me and I can't see my granddaughter, then my daughter-in-law took something I said the wrong way...HUGE misunderstanding.  I have just sent off an apology card and a little \"Hope\" angel, hoping we can go back to being such good friends.  I went to Mexico for my late brother's daughter's wedding end of April 2013.  My sisters all partied on their own and left me out.  Ate most meals alone, went to pool alone, etc.  Left phone messages for them to call me when they were going into town which I really wanted to do.  They never called me.  I had a meltdown there.  It was hard enought to go through the wedding without my brother, but this made it ten times worse.  My heart is broken into many pieces.  My husband is very depressed and stays in bed most of the time.  I feel like a widow.  I feel alone in a crowd.",

After getting on the correct dosage, which ended up being 225mg for me, I felt like my old self again. It's not a \"happy pill\" but simply allows me to feel the emotions of everyday life. I laugh like I used to before my depression, and yet can feel sad and cry at times when it would be typical to feel that way. Before this medication, I was just crying all the time - for no apparent reason. Other meds have caused me to feel NO emotions at all. Yes, the weight gain of about 15 pounds was frustrating but I could also do more to lose it. I do sweat more as well. I have only missed one dose and there were very minimal side effects which I was expecting - headache, some tingling when I moved my head suddenly.  When I told my doctor these side effects, he asked me if it was worth taking.......ABSOLUTELY. I know it isn't for everyone but for me - I'm just fine with it. I have my life back again.",

If you take this pill, you'll be at risk of heatstroke on 80 degree days if you're in the sun too long. You'll have high blood pressure that you didn't have before, too. I'm a recovering cocaine and crack addict (7 years clean) and the withdrawals from Effexor XR make coke/crack withdrawals seem like a case of the sniffles. Unlike street drugs, the longer you go without Effexor XR in your system, the more the withdrawals make you think you're dying.

    "Post": "I was changed to this medication because I was sleeping too much on my other drug.  this drug didn't help any and made me gain 15 lbs over 9 mo.  Upon seeing a new dr. and being prescribed a different drug, I was surprised to discover that the \"flu\" I was experiencing was in fact withdrawal from this drug.  With an increasing dose of the new drug I am still dealing with withdrawal \"flu\", increased depression, etc.  I have NEVER experienced anything like this while changing any other antidepressant.  DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!  There are so many options that do not result in a withdrawal like this!!",

    "Post": "My personal experience with with drug tells me there are no good reviews on this drug. The 5 star reviews are just INCOMPLETE reviews, that in time will show this nasty drug for what it is. 7 years on 150 mg. Effexor xr, things were okay, at this point my review would have been positive. Sooo I no longer felt I needed or wanted to take this\"medicine\" due to the many, many side effects. I had experienced the negatives 4 hours after my regular scheduled dose... headache would become a migraine with sweating and soon I would be vomiting. so I decided to ween off the pills slowly. My doctor takes me from 150 mg. to 75 mg. I think I can handle it, I was wrong. After 5 months of hell I'm trying to figure out what to do next... Be warned this chemical demon they call effexor is not your savior. My experiences I do not share make me feel like I'm in spiritual warfare.",
